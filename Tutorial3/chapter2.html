            	<h1 style="text-align:center; font-variant:small-caps">The Rolling Cart</h1>
            	<p>Again, I saw the king&rsquo;s men, elegantly dressed, mounting  their well decorated horses after a drink from the lake, I normally wait to see  them pass through this path as they make their rounds watching the city. After  every three sun sets, a new team will pass. They are bold and strong and make  us feel safe. I particularly like the leader of the Pack. He rides in front and  leads the way. He tells them when to stop and what to do. &ldquo;One day I will lead  that pack Harry said to himself, &ldquo;and protect the city too, I will lead an army  of men&rdquo;. Moments later, as I walked down on the foot path near the sloppy  plains on my way home, I heard loud screaming. I saw one horse running away in a  distance without a rider and the other horses making snorting noises. I heard  loud voices and what sounded like men fighting and so I quickly hid behind a  small rock and watched unnoticed. The king&rsquo;s men had been ambushed by hoodlums.  The fight was fierce but the hoodlums outnumbered the king&rsquo;s men. Only the  leader of the pack was still standing and it looked like he will give in soon  as he had three men fighting him alone. Wandering what to do to help, I looked  around and the only thing in sight was a wooden cart supported by two big  stones, so it won&rsquo;t roll down the slope. I removed the two stone and let the  cart roll from the top of the slope towards the fighting men and in a sudden  panic from the noise of the uncontrollable cart rolling fast towards them and  not sure what to expect, the hoodlums abandoned the fight and fled leaving the  kings men by themselves. The kings men looked up in the direction of the  rolling cart saw me standing and realized what happened, they called out to me  to join them.<br />
            	  They thanked me for saving their lives as some of the soldiers  were seriously wounded. While they nursed their wounds, the leader of the pack  engaged me in a conversation and commended me for being such a brave lad. I  went on to tell him stories of how I killed a bear and a Lion when they tried  to attack my sheep and he was fascinated and called the others to come and hear  my stories.  I also told them of my dream  to join the king&rsquo;s army in the future. The soldiers looked at him in shock and the  head of the pack turned and addressed him as he would a superior officer and  said, &ldquo;One day, you will lead the army to victory and protect the people you  love so much&rdquo;. I kept his words safely fastened in my heart as I added today&rsquo;s  episode in my chronicles of fights and waiting for the next.<br />
            	  David knew he was a warrior and a leader of his people and  he had an eye for the rulership. Even though he was just a shepherd boy. He was  later anointed by Samuel but he knew it was a long journey. He always looked  for opportunities that added value to his campaign, while waiting for the appointed  time to lead his people. That was the same reason he fought goliath, it took  him closer to his dream. <br />
           	  So that is the attitude you should have when you are waiting  for your dreams to come true. </p>
                <h2><a name="_Toc459881013" id="_Toc459881013">The  Adventure</a></h2>
                <p>When you discover or begin to understand what problem you  are wired to solve and you begin to take steps in that direction, a fresh  consciousness begins to grow in you that you are now living on purpose and this  brings a sense of fulfillment to you. The fact that every day is part of Gods  big picture makes the day promising and exciting and that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s an  adventure. The most exciting thing about an adventure is that you have an aim,  something you want to achieve at the end of your expedition. Regardless of the  challenges you come across, you are still focused. That is the whole idea, even  when you are faced with circumstances that are not so pleasant; it becomes easy  to see why you have to be strong and resolute.  God designed your adventure as part of His  plan for you to be full of support for your growth and development.  The need to then remain close to God to keep  you on track in your adventure becomes very important. It affects the things  you say and the things you do because you don&rsquo;t want anything that will derail  you from the plan that God has for you. In the same vein, you live your life  wisely acknowledging that you are on a journey and the success of that journey  depends on you.  Your adventure is not a  timeless period of uncertainty and confusion. It is phased into times and  seasons, tailor made for you to fulfill purpose as will be discussed in the next  topic.</p>
                <h2><a name="_Toc459881014" id="_Toc459881014">Time  and Phases</a></h2>
                <p>The journey of purpose takes a life time. God only reveals  the big picture or the blueprint to you so you can have an idea because if He  told you everything, you will not be able to handle it. Hence, He wants you to  depend on Him for directions on what to do per time. This is because:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>God is all knowing; he knows the details of your future  and that of everyone else in the world.</li>
                  <li>God wants you to develop complete trust in Him with your  life because He knows what is best for you.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>That is why the adventure in fulfilling your assignment is  phased over time; God&rsquo;s plan for you is divided into basically two seasons<br />
                  1. Preparation<br />
                  2. Manifestation<br />
                  God will direct and guide you in carrying out his plan which  is your assignment. He will lead you to start the preparation and when you are ready,  He will lead you to the place of assignment to kick off. God has everything  planned in phases and he will communicate it to you just in time. All God  demands from you is your attention and obedience. Once you have discovered the  problem you are designed to solve, the next thing is to prayerfully seek  development in that direction. Read books, attend trainings and seminars and  associate with people in that circle. God will definitely order your steps to  every place of preparation that you will need in carrying out your assignment.  A wise man once said that when preparation meets with opportunity, you have a  manifestation, what I like about this statement is the fact that God creates  opportunities any time He likes and that makes me feel safe and encouraged to always  be prepared.</p>
                <h2><a name="_Toc459881015" id="_Toc459881015">Stay  at your Post</a></h2>
                <p>It is important to note that as you step out preparing to fulfill  your assignment,   there will be  challenges, distractions and even discouragements. These are normal and should  only make you stronger. If you turn away, you will live to face them another  day. Your assignment will not change even if you runaway. So, be determined to  face it and succeed. Stay committed to your call even when you are not sure of  what next to do; just keep your hands busy and your heart connected to God.  Consistency is of absolute necessity when it comes to fulfilling your  assignment. Let God always find you at your post and let there be traces of you  and your activities around your assignment.  As much as possible let the things you commit  to connect to your assignment in one way or another.  There is always a cost that comes with  fulfilling your God given dream; it may be your time, energy, sleepless nights,  study research and even disappointments. But when you realize that it&rsquo;s all part  of the package, you are encouraged to continue. So, when you get to one of such  days remember I told you, days like that will come. All you need to do is just  face them and God will help you overcome them and you will be fine. Remain at  your post and don&rsquo;t wander away. It&rsquo;s part of the adventure and it prepares you  to stand firm in tough times that lie ahead.</p>
