        <h1 style="text-align:center">Chapter Three</h1>
            <h1 style="text-align:center; font-variant:small-caps">First Bride</h1>
            <p>In the mountain plains of Nede, one of the most luxurious  sights of nature, the ceremony just ended as the custom demanded before wedding  preparations will start.  The beautiful  and young daughter of the king already betrothed to a man and they were to get  married. Her beauty was exceptional, she was every man&rsquo;s dream and her husband  to be was constantly being told, how lucky he was. Not only was she beautiful  but she was virtuous and industrious. The little kids loved her and the maidens  respected her. The old women blessed her and the old men were proud of her and  of course she was the toast of every young man.   It was a few months to the wedding and plans for the ceremony were at  different stages of completion. The groom told everyone that cared to listen  about the lofty plan he had for his bride. He did not only speak of the grand  wedding ceremony he was planning, the kind never seen before but he equally spoke  of the quality of life they will enjoy in the marriage, he talked about the  good times that will never end and the great family they will build spreading  their joy and laughter to many generations to come. The town was agog with the  news and everyone waited to see how it will all unfold.<br />
Months became days and days became hours, then much talked  about moment finally came. There was something different about the sun rise  that morning; you could tell something great was about to happen, like the dawn  of a cultural festival, but it was just a wedding ceremony, a covenant-making  day. The square was full in minutes and true to his word the ceremony was like  no other. You should see the decorations, the designs were heavenly and the  concept was brilliant, every one said the same thing. &ldquo;We have never seen  anything like this&rdquo;.  All the unmarried  guests were dreaming again squashing their former plans and dreaming bigger,  the already married folks wished they could repeat their ceremony. It was the  appearance of a grand event. With a lot of cheering and whistling, the groom  appeared elegantly dressed, and with confidence he walked the down the aisle,  accompanied by gently playing music that made even the plants come alive. Then  the tempo of the music changed and all eyes turned to the entrance for the  grand entry of the bride. Finally she showed up. To some it was the dress to  others her beauty or was it the jewelry or the fragrance; everything she wore  did not go unnoticed. Mouths were left wide open in awe of her beauty until  she ended her procession and she stood staring  at her lord, the prince and for some unknown reason the glow on her face  evaporated into thin air, on what was supposed to be the happiest day of her  life. This did not go unnoticed by her lord and prince who was so excited and  had imagined every scene of the grand event months before. However he dismissed  his thoughts and turned to face the priest to continue with the important  proceedings. On and on the priest continued and finally he ask, &ldquo;is there  anyone who has any reason why this lovely couple should not be joined in holy  matrimony&rdquo; in that absolute silence that lasted for just a few seconds, but  like eternity for some, the priest then motioned on to say, &ldquo;I pronounce ………No  No No…&rdquo; shouted a loud voice from the end of the hall. In a very sarcastic  manner, and feeling confident and full of himself, he casually strolled approaching  the altar, he was shabbily dressed, but gently spoke to the priest, &ldquo;Sir&rdquo;, he  said, &ldquo;I am afraid you cannot just join this lovely couple together today. He  still sounded sarcastic shrugging his shoulder in and out. He kept his gaze  steady and wasn&rsquo;t looking at anyone in particular most of the time. Except to  steal a glance at the priest, the groom and the head bowed bride. The priest  then asked why and everyone was silent waiting to hear what the reason was. In a  very dramatic gesture he turned and looked at the bride and said, &ldquo;Ask her&rdquo;. In  shock, all eyes turned to the bride, she uttered no word but kept her head  bowed to the ground, never looking up for a second, everyone waited for a  response from the bride but she uttered not a word. At this time her sobs was  getting louder and this did not sound like she had a defense. The groom was  furious at this point and was constantly been calmed down by his grooms-men who  had to hold him down. He sought to get a response from his bride but she will  not utter a word but her sobs greatly increased. The shabbily dressed stranger  gladly announced that he would have to leave with the bride as she had  something that belonged to him and since there was no objection from the bride,  he went on to say &ldquo;we beg to take our leave now&rdquo;. The groom tried to get an  explanation from the bride but to no avail. You could see the bitterness in his  eyes as the stranger pulled the reluctant bride down the aisle and he  constantly maintained she had something that belonged to him. The groom stood  motionless for a moment watching his bride go away, with everything he had  carefully planned for go down the drain. Standing right there and thinking  deeply, he knew this was not right. She might have made a mistake; she might  have sold her rights and traded her position, but she was born to rule…. In a  voice loud enough for everyone to hear, he said, &ldquo;this is just the beginning,  there will yet be another feast and I will get my bride back&rdquo;. He said this  with a smile and a confidence that dispelled the fear in his eyes.<br />
The long quest to restore his bride began, he knew she  willingly gave up her marriage on a bait, a fatal mistake but the consequence  of her action was not well thought through, the price for this disobedience is grievous,  but the mercy that love generates is even greater. He knew she was in sorrow  and pain and his love for her will not let him rest. She was designed for more;  a conquering queen, ruling with grace, providing stability and direction. She  does not deserve to suffer, because she was not designed to.  Finally he said, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s begin again, from  where it all started&rdquo;.<br />
This is God&rsquo;s story and exactly how he felt at the beginning  when he lost his most prized possession in the Garden of Eden. It felt like all  hope for his dream was lost, like most of us feel today. We have dreams and we  doubt the possibility of realizing them and sometimes we are not sure if we  even have dreams because of the many challenges we face. It will interest you  to know that, that was also a reality that God faced after he lost man to sin  and the devil in the Garden. That&rsquo;s the way we too feel sometimes. He just  finished laying the foundation to see his dream come through and out of the  blues he lost everything. Well I am glad that God did not lose his dream. He  lost his initial preparation and investments for man but he did not lose his  dream. God had a failure proof plan.<br />
Now, I hope you can trust God with your future. He has been  in the business of building lives and destinies from the beginning and yours  won&rsquo;t be an exception if you would let him. I know the whole idea of your  future appears huge to you but when you look at the curriculum vitae of the one  you have decide to trust with your future you will realize you are in safe  hands. There is no one better in this business and his track record is  unbeatable. Please relax and let us look at this vital principle.</p>
            <h2><a name="_Toc459881017" id="_Toc459881017">Failure  Proof Plan</a></h2>
            <p>God had a failure proof plan. In other words, He had  instructions with consequences or rewards, and where you have instructions and  consequences or rewards, you also have alternative redemption plans for  possible violators. That is, God knew it was possible for man to eat of the forbidden  fruit and hence had a Plan &ldquo;B&rdquo;, eventually man failed and God moved on to plan  &ldquo;B&rdquo; which was the cross. All this was because He still had His dream in focus  and nothing about His dream had changed. In the same vein, we need a failure  proof plan.<br />
              Success is not a destination, it is a process. So to ensure  that you see God&rsquo;s plan fully manifest in your life, you need a plan. Just like  when you want to build a house and you require the services of an architect,  structural engineer, town planner, interior designer, plumber etc. The reason  you need the input of these professionals is so that you don&rsquo;t fail in building  that house and the house will stand and serve the purpose it&rsquo;s built for. In  other words, when circumstances like storms that can bring down the house comes  up, the input of the structural engineer will have taken care of that. The same  applies to the other professionals. So there are actions that you take today  that help to fortify the future against failure. <br />
              In the same way, God had a failure proof plan for man even  after the fall of man in the garden. If God had no backup plan after Adam and  Eve ate the apple that would have been the end of humanity but Plan &ldquo;B&rdquo; was  immediately activated and this required building a new team. The blueprint of plan  &ldquo;B&rdquo; was large enough to be seen at a glance but far too big to be understood in  a glance. It was a long journey with many actors and many locations across  mountains, valleys and seas. Through conflicts, wars and challenges of all  kinds. In fact, it was like a soap opera with many seasons. It had stories of  love and wisdom, leadership and rulership, covenants and promises, rewards and  consequences and pursuits and conquests. Dynasties were born, kingdoms rose and  kingdoms fell, a new people were raised and redemption was guaranteed. All this  was because God still had His dream in focus and nothing about His dream had  changed. The dream to reestablish relationship with man again at Eden, and this  eventually happened when Christ died on the cross and fellowship was finally  restored and man can now connect back to God again just as it was at Eden. Now  you have direct access to God who already knows the future and when you ask Him,  He will tell you exactly what action to take. That will protect you from  failure in the future and even if you fail He will show you how to redeem your  failure, because you have been eternally set up for success, like God&rsquo;s failure  proof plan for the world.</p>
            <h2><a name="_Toc459881018" id="_Toc459881018">Set  Yourself Apart</a></h2>
            <p>It is important to create a specific time in your daily  routine or weekly routine to spend time alone thinking about your life.  Especially as youths and teenagers, it is important to know that regardless of  how society sees you or perceives you, you are the leaders of tomorrow. Anyone  who is an adult today was first a child who passed through the same stages of  growth like you. This is important because you will find adults in two basic  categories, those that lead and those that follow, those that are fulfilled and  those that are unfulfilled, those that give and those that always receive.  How you spend your time as youths will  largely determine which category you are likely to fall into. I will share three  important keys that will help you add value to your life.</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong><em>Constant Study  and meditation on the word of God</em></strong> – The word of God is a mind transforming  agent. It has the innate power to reform your mind and constantly renew your  mind. It opens you up to positivity and destroys negativity. The word of God is  the key to receiving from God; it shows you God&rsquo;s way of thinking and exposes  you to the awesome power of limitless possibilities that will build up your  faith. This prepares you to see beyond failure and helps you to take  responsibility for the success ahead of you. Make studying the word a habit.</li>
              <li><strong><em>Praying  Constantly</em></strong> –  Prayer is our opportunity to discuss with God. It&rsquo;s a time to share what you have  seen in his word with him. It&rsquo;s a time to ask to ask questions on what you  don&rsquo;t understand or how the things you saw in His word will work for you. Prayer  is also a time of communication. You don&rsquo;t only talk to God in prayer; you also  hear from God in prayer so don&rsquo;t just pack up and leave after praying but also  wait and receive. Prayer is not a time to fulfill a religious obligation, but a  time spent on purpose; to receive answers, leaving the place of prayer with  assurance.</li>
              <li><em>Making productive use of your mind (productive thinking)</em></li>
            </ul>
            <p>The two points above, that is, Praying and studying the word  primarily leaves you with a reservoir of rich thoughts and discoveries that you  have to put into constructive use. However, the task of thinking here will  require finding solutions to challenges or problems around you as uniquely  inspired by God. You need to take up the responsibility of being a savior to  accept the prevailing challenges that do not seem to ever end in today&rsquo;s world.  Don&rsquo;t only seek to always receive, desire to contribute and make a change.  As you give yourself to thinking, the  solutions to the problems you are wired to solve will show up. Thinkers are  leaders.</p>
            <h2><a name="_Toc459881019" id="_Toc459881019">The  most important thing</a></h2>
            <p>Finding  the problem you were born to solve and fulfilling God&rsquo;s Plan for your life is  the best thing that can happen to you. In Your assignment is everything you  will need to make your life colourful. Your assignment is your opportunity to create  the future you want. To make it happen you need to create time on a regular  basis to picture this future and begin to pray and plan for it. You need to  give God reasons to pay attention to you and guide you. Having time to think,  pray and plan is a necessity for youths who want to be shining stars tomorrow. It  is a habit you need to develop as part of your lifestyle. It will give you an  edge and keep you ahead of the pack. I will tell you a few things that you can  do in your quiet time to help you maximize the time.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Think about you Potentials  and how you can use them positively</li>
              <li>Think about how  you can improve your Skills and Talents</li>
              <li>Ask God  questions on His thoughts and plans for you.</li>
              <li>Always write  down your thoughts and observations</li>
              <li>Constantly ask  questions and seek answers.<strong> </strong></li>
            </ul>

            </ul>
            <p align="center">1Pet 2:9.<br />
              <em>But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a  peculiar people; that ye should show forth the praises of him who hath called  you out of darkness into his marvelous light</em></p>
            <p align="center">Pro 25:2<br />

            <h3>Life Play</h3>
            <p>It is in moments like this that greatness is born, it&rsquo;s in  moments like this that  ideas are born,  it&rsquo;s in moments like this that God pays attention to you, because God needs  partners on earth to get things done and God has so much to do and few partners  so I know He won&rsquo;t miss out on such an opportunity if you give Him one. Finding  the problem you are designed to solve and becoming who God wants you to be is  not just &ldquo;taking a chance&rdquo; it is taking the chance that guarantees your future. </p>
