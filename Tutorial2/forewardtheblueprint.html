            <p>Fulfilling destiny is not a  destination. It is an assignment, a vision, a mission, a dream, a God ordained  purpose for everyone on the face of the earth. Purpose is not something you  decide, it is something you discover. The discovery of which will find you  either running with a vision, burning with passion, pursuing a dream or going  aggressively on a mission.<br />
              My path crossed with Joe Attah a few years ago whilst he was  passionately and diligently pursuing his God ordained assignment of writing  books for young people. Joe is abundantly qualified to write about purpose,  because it is only a man living in purpose and driven by purpose that can tell  others about purpose. These few years, I have come to know the author better.  The steam, passion, drive, energy and sacrifice that purpose demands from a  person are consistently active in all that he does. <br />
              I want to strongly  recommend this book to all young people out there. Follow the stories contained  therein. Let your eyes be open to the secrets they hold. Allow the pages of  this book to fan the embers of your soul until the fire of destiny in you come  aglow. Your future will open up in glory and splendor as you discover,  understand and pursue your God ordained purpose. See you at the top. </p>
