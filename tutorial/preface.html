<h1 align="center"> PREFACE</h1>
<p>Following  my first publication &ldquo;Shadow Cast&rdquo;,  I received a number of questions and responses. One particular lady said, &ldquo;Now  I know myself better and appreciate myself more, and that&rsquo;s fine but <em>why am I here and where do I go from here?</em> What <em>exactly do I have to do and how do I  begin the journey</em>?Everybody  wants to be sure they know exactly what it is they have to do, and precisely  how to live their lives as time lost cannot be gotten back. I looked at this  young lady and I wished I could say to her, &ldquo;<em>you will become an engineer but first you have to go to this university;  and two years after graduation you will find a good man and get married, have  two kids and 10 years later you will be appointed a commissioner, build the  best road your city has ever seen and then you would become the first female this  or that and the list is endless&rdquo;.</em><br />
  I  just wished I could say that, but that&rsquo;s exactly what I cannot say! However,  there is someone who knows exactly what to say and is willing to show you a  glimpse of that big picture and ready to guide you step by step till you see it.  That person is the All-knowing God. I know you know that line already and that  even makes it sound more complex. I agree to some extent but it&rsquo;s actually not  that complex. This is how I know that it is not that complex. If you look  around you right now from where you are and observe the objects around you such  as tables, chairs, cups, cars, or any object at all, one thing they all have in  common is that they were all deliberately made to serve a purpose. Most of these  objects were designed or made by humans. You just think about this, is it  possible for God to create a human being without a purpose or without a reason?  I doubt that. In the same way you are created purposely by God to achieve something.  All you need to do is find out what it is you were created for. <br />
  This  book will help you demystify the myth that God&rsquo;s plan is so unattainable and usually  confusing. It is exactly what God wants for you that he created you for. It is  worth nothing that, you do not choose your assignment; you discover it. The  major reason why it appears difficult for so many is that the importance of  discovering your assignment is not known and so people don&rsquo;t desire it. That is  why before you begin reading this book, you say an honest prayer that exposes  your heartfelt desire to know God&rsquo;s big picture and plan for your life. It all  starts with a fervent desire to be who you were born to be. This is important  because if you don&rsquo;t get the correct picture you may not be able to connect to  it.<br />
  In  my first book SHADOW CAST we established that it all begins with self-discovery  and defining your identity. This is necessary in order to discover the purpose  for your existence. It remains the foundation for a lifelong process of self  mastery. In this book I will attempt to help you locate your assignment and how  to begin the process of becoming the star you were born to be. <br />
  There  are a few important things about the big picture of God&rsquo;s plan or what I call <em>The Blueprint</em> that you need to know.<br />
  Firstly,  you need to know that nobody lives in isolation and no assignment or destiny  exists alone. Whatever God wants you to do, is connected to what he has asked  others to do. You are wired to have a particular assignment and to solve one  major problem and this you need to quickly find out because that&rsquo;s where your  greatest strength lies. In other words, the world is a stage and your role is  to play a character like others to make the play complete and God is the  director.Â  At the end of this book, you  will know what it is you should be looking out for and how you can maximize  your greatest abilities.<br />
  Secondly,  your life is patterns are in stages; these patterns build up gradually from  self-realization to self-actualization, and are developed from Gods big picture  of your life that you are able to see. You will go through different stages of  growth in an ascending order of progress and every stage is time bound; giving  expression to Gods big Picture for you. Every new stage helps you understand  the need for the next. This book will also help you position yourself for the  changes that will accompany your advancement from one stage to the next.<br />
  Thirdly,  the timing for this process is very important; the best time to start is now.  God designed this big picture for you before you were born; failing to start  now is falling behind time. It is very important that people begin this journey  early, particularly young people, but it is never too late for anybody to  start. You stand a better chance of satisfaction when you start early as that  was the plan in the first place. God has already lined up activities for you,  all paving the way for a great manifestation. Everything on earth that is  functional and sustainable has a process. Nothing great and desirable just  happens, there is a process and it takes time. Your journey is a process  monitored by time and for youths reading this right now the timing is perfect,  all you need to do is flow in the consciousness of this timing. With God on  your side as always, you will have a reason to smile through life with  uttermost satisfaction.<br />
  Everyone  was born to make a difference, to contribute something of value to the smooth  running of the world we live in, if you do not know what your role is, then you  are not playing your part. There is no better time to start than now! <br />
  Let the adventure begin.</p>

  <em>For thou hast possessed my  reins: thou hast covered me in my mother's womb. [14] I will praise thee; for I  am fearfully and wonderfully made: marvellous are thy works; and that my soul  knoweth right well. [15] My substance was not hid from thee, when I was made in  secret, and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth. [16] Thine eyes  did see my substance, yet being unperfect; and in thy book all my members were  written, which in continuance were fashioned, when as yet there was none of  them.</em><strong></strong></p>
