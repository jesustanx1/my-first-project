<h1 align="center">LEKKA'S STORY</h1>
<p>It  was a cold evening, the north-east trade wind blew over their faces and with  his usual husky voice Kalunga said, &ldquo;it is particularly windy this year&rdquo; as he  mentioned to what was left of his large family over dinner around the fire. This  is the only month in the year when the rest of my family is complete, and this  year it is particularly important because the last three of my sons have all  completed their manhood trainings. He looked round at his sons, adjusted his  hat on his head and said, After many years of dutiful learning and searching,  you have proved yourselves to be worthy of your own responsibility to keep this  kingdom in her place of pride amongst kingdoms. It is now time to determine  where you belong and like your older siblings before you take your place among  contributors to the wellbeing of this land. <br />
  In  his characteristic manner, he began his usual long speech on special days like  this, my sons, he said, the world is a gift to us but in the real sense we owe  the world a gift, and that gift is inside us. It&rsquo;s amazing how we fit into  certain roles like they were tailor made for us. It is time my sons, to find  that niche and fill it, and of course it is my duty as your father to show you  that path. I have known you boys from when you were born. I know your  strengths, talents, potentials, abilities and you know them too, the next few  months will give us time to determine your perfect fit and you can&rsquo;t miss it.  Tomorrow we will begin our search, thank you boys and have a good night.<br />
  Early  the next morning, Kalunga gathered his three sons together and with their bags  packed, he told them they were embarking on a long journey and it could take  weeks. Malo the oldest of the three asked where it was they were headed and  Kalunga replied, &ldquo;I will tell you as we proceed on this journey,  and you will find your destination when you get there. You will know it, so just  hang on&rdquo;. And so the journey started and for days all they did was cover  grounds and more grounds, camped for the nights and continued in the morning  and as they travelled, Kalunga told his sons the tales of the different places  they passed through, and then suddenly they approached a vast unkept land that  had surprisingly green vegetation even though it was harmattan season. All  along their trail, the grasses had withered away, but this land was  surprisingly green.  Lekka, the youngest  of the boys screamed! &ldquo;This is awesome&rdquo;. The other boys asked what was amusing  him and he showed them the beauty of the land but they didn&rsquo;t seem to  understand. He tried to explain to them how the land could be transformed to a  huge farm and everything a farm can produce could come out of this place all  year round. He kept on talking for minutes as they rode on their horses and  Kalunga, their father listened as the boys argued on how potent the land was  but Lekka the youngest son wouldn&rsquo;t let go on the issue of the land.  Just as they approached a bend on the narrow  road on which they rode, they came across a brook of water, gushing out from a  rock; a natural spring. Suddenly, Kalunga in his husky voice interrupted his  son and announced in a loud voice, &ldquo;Lekka! And he turned around posing like a  knight on horse, and &ldquo;said we have come to the end of your journey, to everyone  on earth is given a time and space, to everyone on earth is given the ability  to make his or her time productive on the space you are given. Lekka, today your  passion has spoken and today your assignment is defined. You will face  challenges and surmount them. You will plow lands and crops will grow. You will  have cattle of different species and you will feed tribes and rescue the hungry.  Your name will give hope as your barn will chase famine from many lands and put  a smile on many faces. On and on he continued until he was done and finally, he  said to Lekka, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t ever forget I am always with you, I am the Lord and Master  of my lands and estates and will be there whenever you need me, to help you all  the way to success. So call out to me when you need anything and I will be  right there. Now go out there and do your thing.&rdquo; Then Kalunga turned to Malo  and Pember and told them in a stern voice that they had to continue on their  journey immediately as their different destinations awaited them. They set out immediately,  and bade Lekka farewell and continued on their way.<br />
  This  story illustrates how we find our passion and our assignment when we build our  relationship with God, and walk with Him and take trips with Him like Kalunga  and his sons. When we do all these, we would then discover what our role is in  time. A relationship with God makes it possible to know where your passion and  assignment lies, because God is the source. Everything starts with God, runs  with God and ends with God. Like Kalunga&rsquo;s sons, they always had access to  their father for guidance and directions, the same is true of God our father.  He is always there for us to guide, protect and direct us on every step of the  way on our journey to fulfill God&rsquo;s purpose.</p>
<h2><a name="_Toc459881009" id="_Toc459881009">Your </a>Passion</h2>
<p>These  two words form one of the strongest phrases I know, and can inform and reform  the mind of anyone seeking fulfillment. It&rsquo;s amazing how God wired every human  to have a passion for something and how that passion lives and grows within us  from child-hood to adult-hood. Passion is often described as a strong feeling  of enthusiasm or excitement about something or about doing something. Passion is  the reason why you hear people say that, &ldquo;I have always wanted to do this from  when I was a kid&rdquo; or they say, &ldquo;I have always had this at the back of my mind&rdquo;.  At the same time, I know someone out there is saying, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t really connect  to anything strong enough and I am not so sure I have a passion for anything&rdquo;. &ldquo;Some  other person may say I think I have a passion for this and that but I am not  always sure&rdquo;. Firstly, we need to know what passion is and what passion is not.  Most people readily assume their talents, gifts and abilities should  automatically determine where their passion lies. Well these are usually  pointers and sometimes appears so but that is not usually the case because it  will mean every 6 foot tall person should be a basketball Player or every  brilliant student should study medicine or because you can paint well you  should be an artist, all that could be true but that does not necessarily guarantee  fulfillment. You may not be satisfied or fulfilled after making those decisions  just because of your ability to do them. You could be 6 feet tall and love to  cook more than anything in the world and eventually become a world class chef.  Below are some questions that can help you sieve your thoughts;</p>
<ul>
  <li>How much effort have you deliberately put into finding  out what your passion might be? Without a deliberate search it is sometimes  difficult to recognize even though it&rsquo;s right inside you</li>
  <li>How much time have you spent praying about where your  passion lies? It&rsquo;s God&rsquo;s idea and He is usually happy to hear you ask.</li>
  <li>What do you enjoy doing even if you are not paid?</li>
  <li> What grieves you  and you don&rsquo;t like to see</li>
</ul>
<p>Every  person out there that really wants to be successful must set apart time for  him/herself to find out where his or her passion lies. Even though there is no  specific time frame that you can fix to determine what your passion is, it is  not a futile pursuit, trust me, it is a question God loves to answer and you  will enjoy the process if you will set quality time apart to find out. This is  because your passion is God&rsquo;s signature on your soul and he will not deprive a  searching heart the answer as it&rsquo;s His idea in the first place that you come to  that awareness.  The day you start asking  God about what your passion is, that day God starts feeling a sense of  accomplishment about you. This is because soon you will be able to see his plan  for you. The suggestions below will help you appreciate your passion clearly</p>
<ul>
  <li>You need to acknowledge that God created you with a  passion for something that will help improve humanity.</li>
  <li>Secondly you do not have to stereotype your thoughts to  think that you should possess a particular passion you know or think</li>
  <li>Your passion does not have to tally with a profession  just yet. It might just be a desire too broad to capture in an occupation.</li>
  <li>You don&rsquo;t choose your passion it&rsquo;s right inside you and  has some kinetic energy flowing in you, just identify with it.</li>
  <li>Passion will instigate you toward a crusade, campaign, a  profession or a practice.</li>
</ul>
<p>Passion makes  you feel part of something beyond you, Passion is not selfish. For example, if I  say I have passion for shoes, this could mean I love making or designing shoes  but not buying every shoe you see or having so many shoes that you can&rsquo;t wear  and saying, oh I just love shoes and that&rsquo;s my passion. That won&rsquo;t exactly be  Passion for shoes. It should include solving a problem around or making more  shoes available.</p>
<p>It is also important to know that our passion does not  always come as jobs or titles. Let&rsquo;s take some examples. If you hate to see sick  people hurting and you have a passion to help them; that is great. But this  does not directly translate into being a doctor, this is because you just may  not be wired to like chemistry and biology and the sciences to see you through  medical school. On the other hand you might love literature and government and  the arts, but this does not change the fact that you have a passion to help  hurting and sick people, all you need to do is to find out how you can use what  you are wired for to achieve the same thing and make your contributions in that  direction, you might work in government to provide policies or in an Non Governmental  Organization to raise funds for the treatment and welfare of this group of  people. It could come up in a number of ways. Acknowledging where your passion  lies helps to direct your path and vocation. It makes more meaning when your  occupation is in line with your passion and that should be your target.<br />
  It is important to note that our passion opens us up to the  world we will love to see but our talents, potential and abilities as well as  the opportunities in our immediate environment help to guide our energies to  achieving something worthwhile. Your passion is not the solution to the  problems of the world, but it creates an environment for your assignment to  incubate and mature.<br />
  How  do you know that what you are suspecting in your heart may be your passion?<br />
  Please find below some important questions you may want to  consider</p>
<ul>
  <li>Does it seek to improve a situation and make it better?</li>
  <li>Does it seek to eradicate an unpleasant situation?</li>
  <li>Does it help to multiply and sustain something that is  good and already working?</li>
  <li>Is it about others, humanity and not just you?</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="_Toc459881010" id="_Toc459881010">Your Talents</a></h2>
<p>Your talents, gifts and abilities are inborn. They are  natural endowments that you possess and you can use with little or no training.  These are God given abilities and skills that make you achieve or solve  problems effortlessly. Your unique ability, gifts or talents are given to you  for a purpose. They are strong indicators to the solution of the problem God  called you to solve either by rendering a service, deploying a skill or managing  a project. Your passion easily fuels your talent, gifts and abilities. Your  talents, gifts and abilities may not ultimately be your assignment but the  medium that will give you access to the problem you are created to solve. In  excising your talents, gifts and ability you develop capacity to own a skill  and build on it. This makes you proficient and confident and helps to provide a  direction for your life. Your talents, gifts and abilities may be artistic,  intelligence based or may require physical strength. God expects you to develop  your gifts and talents and make the most of it. The reason he gave you that  ability is not just so you can make money, have a great life and then die, the  reason he gave you that ability is so that your success can benefit others and  bring glory to Him. Remember everything you enjoy and cannot produce is a  product of another person&rsquo;s talent or gift, if we all kept our talents to ourselves  then, we would have to make a car to own one, sew a shirt to wear one. So desire  to make the impact of your talent felt by others. If you are not so sure what  your talents are, please, find below some important points and questions you  may want to consider:</p>
<ul>
  <li>What things do you do with ease</li>
  <li>Things you can easily do without much practice</li>
  <li>Ask questions from your close friends and family</li>
  <li>Evaluate your past successes</li>
  <li>Try new things from time to time<strong> </strong></li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="_Toc459881011" id="_Toc459881011">Your Dreams</a></h2>
<p>The word dream is dynamic. It is used in various ways to  explain different experiences. However, the basic concept of a dream revolves  around mental pictures of expectations that stir up actions to see the  fulfillment of those pictures and thoughts. The reason why the word dream is  used in different ways is largely because of how these mental pictures are  conceived in the mind of the dreamer.<br />
  Three common sources of dreams</p>
<ul>
  <li>Dreams can be a series of thoughts, images or feelings  that occur in your mind when you are asleep and I believe this comes from God. Sometimes  they may occur a number of times or just once but the images and thoughts  remain vivid and linger for a long time, sometimes even for a life time.</li>
  <li>Dreams also come from thinking and reflecting on a particular  issue over a period of time while you are awake, it usually involves your imagination  and sometimes meditation to have a fully formed picture.</li>
  <li>Dreams can also be born out of a cherished ambition or strong  desire to become or achieve something. This is sometimes inspired by elements  in the environment, like family background or other peculiar experiences growing  up amongst other reasons.</li>
</ul>
<p>Regardless of how the dreams come to you, they belong to you  and that is God&rsquo;s way of communicating an assignment to you. That is why the  mental images and pictures will keep roaming around your mind until you give it  a practical attention.<br />
  Dreams are powerful and it is one of the ways that God  communicates His plans to man. Dreams are personal and have a supernatural ability  to empower the dreamer. Dreams have the power to fuel your imagination and  propel you to think and create the reality. Dreams reveal the details of the  future and help us to see the possibilities in achieving what we see.<br />
  Some characteristics of Dreams</p>
<ul>
  <li>A dream makes your assignment clearer.</li>
  <li>Dreams motivate you to sharpen your talents as you now  know what to use it for.</li>
  <li>Dreams inspire you not to give up when challenges arise.</li>
</ul>

<p align="center"><em>Exodus  35 v30-35</em><br />
  <em>Moses told the Israelites, &ldquo;See,</em><em>&nbsp;</em><em>God</em><em>&nbsp;</em><em>has selected Bezalel son of Uri, son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah. He&rsquo;s  filled him with the Spirit of God, with skill, ability, and know-how for making  all sorts of things, to design and work in gold, silver, and bronze; to carve  stones and set them; to carve wood, working in every kind of skilled craft. And  he&rsquo;s also made him a teacher, he and Oholiab son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of  Dan. He&rsquo;s gifted them with the know-how needed for carving, designing, weaving,  and embroidering in blue, purple, and scarlet fabrics, and in fine linen. They  can make anything and design anything.&rdquo;</em></p>

<h3>Life Play</h3>
<p>Basically, your passion, talents and dreams are key indicators  to what direction your life is heading and what problem you have been created  to solve. It is important to note that you do not need to know these three  indicators all at once or in any particular order to fulfill your assignment. They  are interwoven and as you begin to make progress with any of them that you have  discovered the rest will naturally find expression. So on your quest to  fulfilling you assignment and understanding these key indicators you need to  prayerfully commune with God to lead and direct you.</p>
