<h1 align="center"> CHAPTER TWO</h1>
<p>THE SPIRIT, SOUL AND BODY<br />
  Man is a tripartite being made up  of the spirit, soul and body. These three parts have different functions but  they all work together.<br />
  THE BODY: This is the physical  structure of man i.e. the physical part of a person that can be seen and  touched. The body is mortal and it will decay when a man dies. The body is that  part of a man that is selfish and desires satisfaction. It is the fleshy part  the bible says we should not gratify. The body of a man responds to his soul  and spirit. It sometimes contradicts the spirit because of its lustful desires.  It is the part of man that will return to the soil and decay. Hmm, vanity upon  vanity. Why then do we gratify our fleshly desires when it profits nothing and  will decay?<br />
  THE SOUL: It is the immortal part  of man. It is not physical. It is the faculty of reasoning, will and emotion.  The soul of a man is responsible for his thoughts, imaginations, visualization,  his feelings and where he creates his fantasies. The soul responds to the  spirit of man. A natural man thinks of evil because of his nature and spirit.  Oh! You may say that there are natural men that do no evil, but the truth is  that there is none. Any natural man who does or acts well has only brought in  moral standards into his life by religion, culture and societal standards as  discussed in earlier factors. It will be good to note that these standards are  just temporary actions. They act well outside but their thoughts are evil. A  man's soul is affected by his spirit, which he possesses. Feed your soul with  the word of God.<br />
  THE SPIRIT: This is the eternal  part of man. This is the real man that will be judged after death. Man is a  spirit being. God created us in His own image and likeness (Genesis 1:26). God  is a Spirit (John 4:245a). <br />
  <br />
  But as a result of the fall of  man, the evil spirit entered into him. Now, Jesus Christ has reconciled us back  to the father. So when we got saved in Christ, we became possessed by the  Spirit of God. A man can either be possessed by the Holy Spirit or an evil  spirit. You cannot be possessed by both spirits at a time. The spirit of man is  the candle of the Lord, searching the inward parts of the belly (Proverbs  20:27). Man communicates with God via his spirit and as a believer, our spirit  searches for the deep things of God. God communicates primarily with the spirit  of man and the evil one does the same through their own means.</p>
<p>We the children of God speak in  tongue and mysteries are unfolded to us as we tarry more in His presence.  Building up your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Ghost. Our faith is built  up when we pray in the Holy Ghost.<br />
  At salvation, our body did not  change. If you were a woman before you accepted Christ, you are still a woman  afterwards. If you are tall before salvation, you are still tall afterwards.  Our spirit changes automatically when we confess Christ as our Lord. The spirit  of God comes to us and our old nature leaves. Now, at salvation, our soul  doesn't change automatically. This is where a lot of believers miss it. But  it's subject to change by renewing our mind daily with the word of God. Though  the spirit has influence over us, our mind is a programmed device, it has been  programmed with the old nature so it takes the word of God to reprogramme it.  Also, the word of God makes us aware of who we are in Christ.<br />
  One of the biggest mistakes  people make when trying to understand others is looking at their behaviour out  of context or their psychological make-up.<br />
  The problem with that approach is  that it results in a superficial judgement of others based on one situation.  The other approach is that it doesn't take into consideration that two people  could be doing the same thing for different reasons. We behave and do many of  the things we do as a result of experience.<br />
  The subconscious mind directs  people's actions and if you want to understand why people behave the way they  do, then you must clearly understand their past for it holds the clue to that  which you seek.</p>
<p> <br />
  Temperament is the combination of  inborn traits that subconsciously affect all our behaviour. These traits which  are passed on by our genes are based on hereditary factors and arranged at  conception. Our individual temperament influences what we focus on. Our  individual temperament affects our daily habit – the way we interact with  people, clean our house, drive, do our daily chores, etc.  A person's gender will also affect his or her  temperament, especially when it comes to emotions. For example, women are  emotionally expressive than men. Even the strongest woman tends to cry while  men may weep once in a while or secretly. A man and a woman may have the same  temperament but they largely express emotions differently. It is a person's  temperament that makes one introvert or extrovert.<br />
  At our moment of conception, we  all inherited a basic genetic temperament that contains both our strengths and  weaknesses. This temperament is called so many things in the bible -- the  flesh, natural man, the old man, etc.<br />
  If you think deeply, you will see  that you possess one or two of your parents' or grandparents' temperament. I  remember when my baby started crawling. I will always shout at her unknowingly  to leave one place or the other. Aside from that, she does some things that  should require just a talk from me but I will shout at her. It then occurred to  me that I was beginning to exhibit my mum's temperament which is a weakness on  her side. I had to pray to God and allow the Holy Spirit to help my weakness.  Yours could be a different story, but mind you, one's temperament could either  be a weakness or strength. For example, a man can be quiet while another is  troublesome, etc. Temperament has more influence on our behaviours. It is the  number one influence on us. For us to properly understand our temperament, our  actions and reactions, then we need to understand some terms properly:  personality, character, attitude and behaviour. </p>
<p>CHARACTER<br />
  The character is the real you. It  is what you do in the secret. It is what you do when you are given freedom to  do anything that suits you. It is the mental and moral quality that  distinguishes you from others. It is a product of your temperament modified by  childhood training, environment, education, beliefs, attitudes, principles,  motivations, habits, etc. It is the net result of all the influences of people  around you from your childhood till now through education, culture, religious  beliefs, societal traits or influence, etc. The character is simply an  expression of who you are.<br />
  <br />
  ATTITUDE<br />
  Attitude is your response or  reaction with respect to your character and personality. It is your mannerism  or feeling about something as a result of your ideology resulting from your  character.<br />
  <br />
  BEHAVIOUR<br />
  Behaviour is the way you act or  conduct yourself, especially to others. Behaviour is your response to  situations.<br />
  <br />
  PERSONALITY<br />
  Personality is defined as the  habitual behaviour, discernment and emotional patterns that evolve from our  temperament. It is the outward expression of one's self which may or may not be  the same as one's character, depending on how truthful or sincere the person is  to himself or herself. You can deceive others but you cannot deceive God and  yourself. Some people tend to portray what they are not inwardly just for the  acceptance and praise of men but it doesn't last for a long time. Like an adage  says, &quot;Your character is like a flame it cannot be hidden for long&quot;.  Your personality is your modified character. Many are acting on the basis of  what they think they should be as a person, rather than who they really are.  Whatsoever you do inside and you cannot portray outside is not your real  personality.</p>
<p>Your character can be modified  when you discover it's bringing havoc to you. It starts with your heart and the  willingness to make a change. Concerning your habit, you must be conscious of  what you do daily, your environment, the people you interact with, what you  listen to, what you watch and read religious beliefs, educational and moral  training. All of these influence your character and it can be modified if you  properly train yourself.</p>
<p>After merely meeting someone for  the first time and if the person talks with me for some few minutes, I can  actually say a little of what he/she is made up of from our conversation. What  you say tells a lot about your mind, heart, knowledge, wisdom, understanding  and your reasoning. You cannot give what you don't have. You only talk to the  extent of your knowledge and exposure. I can tell if you are a natural man,  spiritual or carnal. Our conversation is an end result (product) of our  thoughts.<br />
  <br />
  DIFFERENT TYPES OF TEMPERAMENTS<br />
  There are four kinds of people  based on temperaments. They are the sanguine, choleric, melancholy and  phlegmatic which can also be summarized into three which are: the introvert,  extrovert and the ambivert.<br />
  <br />
  SANGUINE<br />
  The sanguine are lively and  fun-loving people. They talk a lot. Anywhere they go, they are always  recognized. When they are in a particular setting, they tend to lift the soul  of people with their jokes or talk. They are never tired of talking. The  sanguine don't lack friends. They make friends by themselves. People don't turn  their friendship down because of their jovial attitude. They don't like  isolated places; they never lack words for different occasions.<br />
  <br />
  CHOLERIC<br />
  The choleric are the super  active, quick, strong-willed, hard and practical people. The choleric thrive on  activities. They are always up and doing, they are not moved by challenges,  they are dictators. They are mostly independent and self-sufficient. They are  mostly strict and abide by the principles that guide their existence. </p>
<p>MELANCHOLY<br />
  The melancholic are the quiet,  self-sacrificing type. They keep to themselves. They are secretive, gifted,  perfectionists and very sensitive emotionally. They love things done orderly.  They don't love to be criticized, they are principled and detailed people. They  are easily hurt because of their perfectionist nature, and they are analysts  and information gatherers. They are very slow to react but keep grudges, they  don't forget easily. They respond to things that hurt them with sadness and  tears.  They make people feel guilty  rather than insult them.<br />
  <br />
  PHLEGMATIC<br />
  The phlegmatic are calm,  easy-going, eager to please people, givers, peacemakers, indecisive, calm,  neat, and organized. They love spending time with friends and are very loyal to  their friends. They help people while they silently die with their problems.  They fear judgement so they keep to themselves. They are excellent and  attentive listeners.</p>
