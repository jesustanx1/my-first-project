<h1 align="center"> CHAPTER FOUR</h1>
<p align="center"><br />
  Have you ever asked yourself; why  am I here on earth? Have you ever asked yourself why some things cannot be  replaced with other things because they will not function well? For example,  why can't we use a fork to serve soup? Why can't we use a spoon to brush our  teeth? It sounds ridiculous, right? You mean it's a ridiculous question, yeah!  Mind you, that is how most people have been living their life in an abusive  manner. Many lives are like a fork that is supposed to pick food but they are  using it to dish soup thereby wasting the soup. You have to stop abusing your  life now and get into action. Remember, life is just a temporary assignment.  Purpose is another deep topic that God unveils to me daily. I may not go deep  in this book but I will surely shed light on this all-important topic.<br />
  Purpose is your &quot;WHY&quot;.  It is the reason for your existence. Purpose can also be defined as the  intention of a thing. For everything you see on earth, it starts from the heart  of someone and there is a reason for it. For everything on earth, there was  first a preconception by its creator. A mental putting together of the unique  reason for this intended creation. No wonder there is a saying that if the  purpose of a thing is not known abuse is inevitable. Have you ever bothered to  discover your purpose for existence or are you just living every day as it  comes?<br />
I want you to know that God  created you and I for a reason and that reason is to bring glory to His name.  It is only the manufacturer of a thing that knows the original intent or  purpose of that thing. Do you agree with me? Yes! It is only God that knows our  purpose because he had something in mind before and when He created us. But to  understand the purpose of a product that we just purchased, we need its manual.  It is only when we study the manual thoroughly that we will understand the  purpose and function of that product. The word of God is our manual given by  God as His primary source of communicating His intentions to us (See 2 Timothy  3:16). The word of God contains everything we need to know about God, ourselves  and things we were designed to do.</p>
<p>There is a general purpose and  the specific purpose for everyone. The general purpose of man is to bring glory  to the name of God and spread the Good News of Christ while every one of us has  a specific purpose which must go down to our general purpose. For example, the  general purpose of a phone is for communication. All phones receive/send text  messages and make calls while individual types of phones have their specific  purposes. For example, a Nokia 3310 phone can't do the work of a Samsung  Galaxy. I hope you are getting me right? Ok, good! So you are here for a  reason. There is a purpose for you reading this book and there is also a  purpose for me writing this book.<br />
  WHY YOU NEED TO DISCOVER YOUR  PURPOSE<br />
  You need to discover your purpose so that life  will be easy and simple for you. The day you discover your purpose is the day  you really begin to live. It's the day you find clarity for yourself. This  discovery makes life easy for you and helps you celebrate others. It takes envy  out of your life. Knowing your purpose gives you direction. You don't just  follow the crowd as there will be clarity in your life. This knowledge  beautifies your life and makes you impact others. Knowing your purpose gives  you focus. Knowing your purpose prepares you for eternity.  Fulfilling your God-ordained purpose brings  glory to God. Knowing your purpose and fulfilling it refresh you and make you  grow. Purpose makes you engage but doesn't take away your feelings instead it  helps you control them. When you are so engrossed with God's purpose for your  life, you will understand people and how to relate to them and also get over  hurts and disappointments easily.<br />
  <br />
  You can't be purpose-driven and be  too weakened emotionally. Purpose is a burden. It is a quest, an assignment  given by the Creator. Purpose makes you occupied. When you understand purpose  and you are fulfilling it, It makes you get busy and always ready to meet  people's needs that God has brought along your path. When you are fulfilling  purpose, there is a hunger for you to grow, to unleash and become a better  version of you. You are just too busy doing God's assignment to be emotionally  down.<br />
  HOW TO DISCOVER PURPOSE<br />
  As I said, it is only the Creator  that knows our purpose and that is why we need to connect with Him in order to  know our purpose. If you have not confessed Christ as your Lord and Saviour,  this is another opportunity for you. For you to discover your purpose, you need  to fellowship with God and by this I mean genuine intimacy. God can communicate  to you through His word, dreams, audible voice, His servants, etc. It should be  noted that God seldom uses dreams as a means of communication in the New  Testament because dreams can easily be manipulated by the devil or simply be a  product of your own subconscious mind.<br />
  SOME CLUES ON HOW TO IDENTIFY  PURPOSE<br />
  • Studying the word of God.<br />
  • The things you love doing is a  clue to your purpose.<br />
  • What drives you is a clue to  your purpose.<br />
  • Your past experiences or  challenges is a clue to your purpose.<br />
  • What makes you sad or grieves  you is a clue to your purpose.<br />
  Discovering your purpose and not  working in purpose or fulfilling is just like putting a battery in a phone  without switching it on; it won't work. You need to discover your purpose,  embrace it and fulfil it.<br />
  LIFE IS SPIRITUAL<br />
  Have you heard people say when  things happen to them; that is what life has brought to me. No, life doesn't  make you. You design the kind of life you want for yourself. You are the  architect of your life. Life should not demand from you; you demand from life.  No wonder God's word says &quot;he hath given unto us all things that pertain  unto life and godliness&quot; 2 Peter1:3.<br />
  &quot;I call heaven and earth to  record this day against you, that I have set before your life and death,  blessing and cursing: therefore choose LIFE, that both you and your seed may  live&quot; (Deuteronomy 30:19).<br />
  Nobody wants good for you except  your Creator. Even your parents may desert you. &quot;Can a woman forget her  sucking child, that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb? YEA,  they may forget, yet will I not forget thee.&quot; (Isaiah 49:15).      <br />
  It is only God that can never  forget or fail you. <br />
  Therefore, you have to be  intentional about your life. Demand all the good things God has promised you  through Prayer. &quot;And from the days of John the Baptist until now the  kingdom of heaven suffers violence, and the violent take it by force  &quot;(Matthew 11:12)             <br />
  God will not want you to do what  He has not given you the ability to do.   He will not do for you what He has given you the ability to do.  Therefore, WAKE UP! &quot;For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but  against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of  this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.&quot; (Ephesians  6:12). <br />
  The devil always contends with  God's plan for your life every day. Surely, they will gather but their  gathering will not stand. The devil is like a roaring lion seeking whom to  devour. He has seen a promising future in you. Therefore, you have to pray to  get your inheritance and possess your possessions. <br />
  You can't pray well if you don't  study the word of God. So, it's not just prayer alone that matters; you also  need to study the word of God. It is the word of God that gives you more  knowledge and wisdom about God's promises for your life and also boost your  prayer life. Affirm God's word for your life, build your spirit man and grow in  faith with the word. Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God.  The more you affirm the word to yourself, the more it sinks into your spirit  through your subconscious mind and you will see the manifestation when the word  becomes flesh in your life. Also, it is not just by the word and prayers alone  because most times, we are so religious we pray a lot but no results. This may  be because we do not practise the word and principles of God we study. There  are principles and laws of life to follow. The word of God has so many examples  of people who demonstrated many of these principles of life. Our greatest  example is our Saviour, Jesus Christ. Things don't just happen. You have to  take charge of your life. There is a price for everything. YOUR SUCCESS HAS A  PRICE TAG. Do what you need to do now and avoid regrets. Don't joke around when  you need to pray.  Make your SACRIFICES  now. There are two kinds of pains you may go through; the pain of discipline  and pain of regrets. If you don't go through the pains of discipline now, you  will go through pains of regrets later.</p>
<p>If you don't endure the pains of  discipline today, you will endure the pains of regret tomorrow. Stop  complaining about life because of the people who have hurt you, broken your  heart or deserted you. Rather, get up and face your challenges. Get over that  hurt, brokenness and depression. Turn your pain to gain. Turn it to your own  advantage. I turned my pain into a great advantage by writing this book. I am  certain that you have been blessed reading so far. Then stand up and tell yourself  I can get over everything and move on.</p>
<p>Be strong in God. Fight the  battle with the word of God, pray, practise and confess the word and obey  life's principles. Let your thoughts be governed by the Spirit of God. Be  positive, stay away from negative people. Live for something, I mean be  purpose-driven and you will see everything turning around for you. &quot;When  the Lord turned again the captivity of Zion, we were like them that dream&quot;  (Psalm 126:1). It will appear as a dream to people when the Lord turns your  life around.</p>
<p>God's plan for you is beautiful.  He says &quot;Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the  heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him.&quot;  (1 Corinthians 2:9).<br />
  I believe in you. The world  awaits your manifestation. I say again, get up, darling. Jesus loves you. I  love you and I believe in your future.</p>
