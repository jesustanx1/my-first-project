<h1 align="center"> CHAPTER ONE </h1>
<p>&quot;The heart is deceitful  above all things, and desperately wicked: who can know it?&quot; (Jeremiah 17:9  KJV)<br />
  You need to know that man is man  and nothing can change that. The bible says the heart of a man is desperately  wicked, who can know it? Thank God for the Holy Spirit who is dwelling in our  heart and the godly character we possess through Him. Naturally, man is either  arrogant, covetous or possessive in nature.   Every man is defined by his temperament. In this chapter, I will be  sharing deep truths about temperament as it applies to every man.<br />
  To avoid any form of  disappointment from humans, it is important to understand human composition  especially in the aspect of reasoning and what we are made up of. <br />
  <br />
  WHO IS MAN?<br />
  What is man that thou art mindful  of? (Psalm 8:4)<br />
  In a deep thought in respect to  the dealings the psalmist had with men, he asked a question, what is man that  God is mindful of? God created man in His own image and likeness and this is  why man is very special to Him. The pinnacle of God's creative work is His  creation of man. God specially created man to be more like Him more than any of  His creation (Genesis 1:26-28).<br />
  God created man to show forth His  glory. (Isaiah 43:7). Therefore, we are to glorify God in all that we do.<br />
  Man is a tripartite being -  spirit, soul and body. It is with the spirit that man worships and connects  with God. God is a Spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit  and truth. The soul includes the conscious and subconscious mind, the realm of  emotions and the will. The soul gives a man personality, self-awareness,  rationality and natural feelings.<br />
  The body is a complex physical  creation by which a person relates to this world and its inhabitants. We now  know that every person's body is a large measure of the product of his DNA code  which exists in his body to programme his development. As marvelous as the body  may be, man has a non-physical aspect which consists of a different kind of  immortality. It is this part of man that is eternal.<br />
  Man is described as a living soul  which came into being by the breath of God (Spirit). Since man is a three-part  being, whatsoever happens to one part affects the other.</p>
<p>THE NATURE OF MAN<br />
  Man's nature is so complex to  explain because it is very difficult for one to understand. It is only God who  created man that knows the depth of man's nature.<br />
  &quot;All scripture is given by  inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for  correction, for instruction in righteousness&quot; (2 Timothy 3:16)<br />
  One needs to understand that the  scripture was birthed out of inspiration by God to man. God inspired men to  write the Holy book, so it is only God that knows every of His thoughts,  motives and intentions about man. But according to the scripture, the original  intention of God is to fellowship with him.<br />
  Man is God's creation. God  created man for a purpose. Therefore, man cannot live on his own. God is  indispensable in the world of man. Man is dependent on God. According to  creation, the original intention of God for man is to be like Him, have His  wisdom, think like Him, be holy like Him, and to be powerful like Him. In other  words, man should possess His attributes and character.<br />
  There was a cordial and mutual  fellowship between God and man. A sweet one to say. There was no sense of evil,  guilt, hatred or any negativity of any sort. It was all pure love. The spirit  called man was pure without blemish. The heart was pure and clean with no  thought of evil. Oh! How beautiful it was for man to fellowship with God  freely, play with him in the cool of the evening like children listening to  fairy tales. It was so beautiful and awesome not until the devil deceived man  which was the cause of God turning His heart against man.<br />
  Immediately man violated the  instruction of God, everything turned dark for him like a sudden eclipse of the  sun. The spirit of man became governed by evil.   Man's original nature was defiled because of sin. </p>
<p>According to the scripture,  &quot;the spirit of man is the candle of the Lord&quot; Proverbs 20:27. The  light on the candle went off immediately man fell; there was nothing like peace  of mind, it was tribulation, calamity and evil here and there. Man became void  and empty of God's nature. The devil began to rule his mind and his heart was  perverted. The fall of man was the beginning of evil in the world. Therefore,  the ordinary nature of man is sin. (Romans 3:23) says &quot;for all have sinned  and come short of God's glory.&quot; This was as a result of the fall of Adam  and Eve. One man's sin affected the entire human race, so Christ had to come as  the second Adam to give man salvation in accordance with Romans 5:12 and 1  Corinthians 15: 21.<br />
  So, according to 2 Corinthians  5:17, anyone who is joined to Christ is a new being, the old nature is gone.  The new has come, and as we renew our minds, we are transformed into his own  image (2 Corinthians 3:18).<br />
  MAN'S SINFUL NATURE<br />
  It Is essential to know that we are all born  with an in-built sinful nature as a result of the fall of man. This nature was  inherited from Adam. Our sins don't make us sinners; they are just an evidence.  We are not sinners because we sin, we sin because we are sinners. Man was born  with the nature of sin so he became an unredeemed man with an untransformed  mind according to Romans 12: 1-2. Man acts wickedly since &quot;the heart of a  man is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked: who can know it&quot;  (Jeremiah 17:9). <br />
  According to Oswald Chamber, sin  is not weakness, it is not a disease, it is a red-handed rebellion against God  and the magnitude of that rebellion is expressed by Calvary. The scripture  affirms this sinful tendency in Psalms 51:4-5.</p>
<p>Definitely, we do not all commit  the same sin, and in many ways, some sins are worse than others. We might also  agree that there is a certain innocence in a child. But make no mistake about  it. The sinful nature is alive and well in every natural man. You don't have to  teach a child to sin, do you? But thanks to Jesus who has reconciled us to the  Father when we receive Him as our Lord and Saviour. At this point, our sinful  nature dies. We are made alive with God. Oh! Glory to God for his mercies.<br />
  THE TRANSFORMED MAN<br />
  Have you heard people say, &lsquo;Oh!  He/she has changed since she got born again. He/She behaves differently.&quot;?  I remember when I got born again, my ideology changed about life totally; my  new birth had changed my perception of life. Transformation is simply a gradual  process of change. It is a type of change that begins from the inward part of a  person to the outward or physical conduct, character and attitude of that  person. Physically, during the life cycle of every living thing, especially  humans, transformation occurs from birth to adulthood. Therefore, every human  experiences transformation. Spiritually, transformation can be likened to  growth. 1 Peter 2:2 says, &quot;As new born babies desire the sincere milk of  the word that ye may grow thereby&quot;. When a person gives his or her life to  Christ, we become spiritual babies. If we are healthy, we will yearn to grow.  In other words, we will yearn to be transformed. Therefore, the need for milk  which is the word of God is a natural instinct for a born again individual,  which is necessary for growth. </p>
<p>For God so loved the world that  He gave His only begotten son, that whosoever believe in Him will not perish  but have everlasting life (John 3:16). Despite the disobedience of man at the  garden of Eden, God still showed us love. The curse in Genesis 3:16 was lifted  in John 3:16. The transformed man is the man that has accepted Jesus Christ as  his Lord and personal Saviour. The scripture says, &quot;be ye transformed by  the renewing of your mind. You need to free your mind from all the dirts it has  been filled with and begin to fill your mind with God's promises for you  through His word. Faith cometh by hearing and hearing the word of God. The more  you confess God's word, the more you build your spirit man. The more you  confess the word of God, the more it enters your subconscious mind and it will  become flesh i.e. reality and your faith is built. <br />
  A transformed man sees life from  God's perspective through the word of God. God's ideology becomes his will. A  transformed man sees others the way God sees them. His culture, traits, and knowledge  are built on the word of God. We act the way we do because of our temperament,  environment, upbringing, acquired knowledge, religious beliefs, culture etc.  Sometimes we just find ourselves exhibiting some of the bad or good characters  of our parents or guardian, or probably you find yourself doing certain things  or people complain a lot about your character, or you don't like your  temperament because you get angry easily and so on. If you really feel bad  about it, I have good news for you. Your character can be changed or modified.  A transformed man is that man who leaves behind all the unripe knowledge he had  had and renews himself through the knowledge of the word of God. He is a man  who sees life from God's perspective and allows the Holy Spirit to take charge  of his life. Our temperament can be modified and that is why we have the Holy  Spirit. A man that wants to fulfil destiny must renew his mind. We have been  fed with a lot of unwholesome ideas while growing up with our parents,  guardians, teachers, environment, religious leaders etc. Many of us that serve  God have not even discovered God by ourselves. We only serve God based on what  we were taught in our places of worship. </p>
<p>When we accept Christ as our Lord  and Saviour, the Holy Spirit comes to live in us. Now, let me quickly give you  a short illustration. Imagine a 20-year old man who has been in a room from  inception. He eats, sleeps and wakes in that room. It is more like he was caged  in the room for 20 years. Suddenly, a man opens the door for him, a bright  light shines on him, he sees the glory of the day, and he has been given total  freedom. He begins to see new things that were strange to him, he sees people  of different shades and size, buildings, cars, roads etc. Do you think the  person can walk on the road when a fast-moving car is coming if not guided?  Reason being that he doesn't know what the outside world looks like because he  has been in the dark all his life. This is similar to when we were in the  world. We have been in the dark. Now we need to be guided in order not to be  crushed by a fast-moving car. We need the word of God to teach us what to do  and what not to do. When we receive Christ, we have the Holy Spirit in us  already. We possess the fruit of the spirit but because of our ignorance, we  don't activate it. We need the word of God to renew our minds.</p>
<p>We can activate the fruit of the  Spirit by constant practice of the word of God. Challenge yourself every day to  practice the fruit of the spirit. For example, if you notice that you are still  struggling with anger, practise patience and love every day by making them your  defence mechanism when you are provoked. Transformation happens when our mind  is renewed in truth and when we have God's belief system. <br />
  WE ALL FALL SHORT OF GOD'S  STANDARD<br />
  When God says &lsquo;'there is none who  does good, no, not one&quot; (Romans 3:12b), He is not saying that there are no  good in humans in general. We all know some people – even unbelievers who have  done some commendable things. God is saying that there is no good in us that  can satisfy Him. When the scripture says &quot;there is one righteous&quot;, He  is not speaking about behaviour but our inner character. Thank God for the  fruits of the Spirit.<br />
  God's standards are high, to say  the least. You must be absolutely perfect. Jesus said: &quot;be perfect, just  as your heavenly father is perfect&quot; (Mathew 5:48.). In other words, a  person who is not as good as God is not acceptable to God. Man is basically not  good because he has sin in him. The reason why many have not come to Jesus  Christ is that they bristle at the thought that they are hopelessly sinful.  They are unwilling to accept God's assessment as to the sinful nature of their  being. The very fact that men react against this teaching is one more proof of  it. In other sense, this sounds pretty hopeless. We have all sin and we cannot  help ourselves except Christ.<br />
  WHY WE ACT THE WAY WE DO<br />
  Our individual temperaments and  character are a result of our actions. Though we are born with a sinful nature,  you know you don't teach a child to sin, right? I think I got a yes from you.  Good! You act the way you do as a result of your upbringing, environment,  ethnicity, culture, religion, belief system, past experiences, etc. All of  these sometimes affect the way we act. You reflect a little character of the  people you are constantly with or the ones you grew up with. Your exposure, the  knowledge you acquire and discovered also affects your behaviour.  No matter how we try to hide our actions, some  traces must be seen on display in one way or the other. They may either be  negative or positive. You only act according to the knowledge you are exposed  to.<br />
</p>
<p> No wonder some people claim that the mind is a  blank slate. All these things make up your thinking faculty or reasoning. You  cannot give what you don't have. You only act or talk to the knowledge of which  you understand. Therefore, if you want to change your life you must change your  mindset. It is only a mad man that will keep doing the same thing repeatedly  and expect a different result. Let me discuss few of the attributes listed  above and how they affect our actions.<br />
  ENVIRONMENT: You are a product of  your environment in a way even though your mindset might change about your  environment later as you grow in knowledge. Your environment tells a lot about  you. A child born in the Northern part of Nigeria thinks differently from a  child from South-south in certain ways e.g. in dressing. The way a child born  in Port Harcourt, Nigeria, dresses is different from the way a child from Kano,  Nigeria, dresses. Why? Because of their environment, culture or ethnicities.  You can be born in a different geographical environment yet think differently.  For example, a child who is brought up in a wealthy environment even if his  parents are of the average class but goes to the same school with the children  of the rich, his mentality will be different from a child from Ajegunle, a  suburb in Lagos notorious for indecent lifestyles.  This is because of the environment. Environment  tells a lot about your personality. Take a deep thought and you will see that  your environment has affected you in one way or the other, especially in areas  of comportment and speech.<br />
  <br />
  RELIGION: Religion is another  factor that affects us. Religion sharpens your morals. A majority don't have a  conviction about God. They go to church or mosque based on what their parents  or guardian are practising.<br />
  THE MIND: The mind is a set of  cognitive faculties including consciousness, perception, thinking, judgement  and memory. The mind is an extraordinarily fertile garden. It will grow any  seed of thought planted and watered on it. The seed of thought sown in your  mind is reaped in your life. Your life shows the quality of your mind.  You become what you think about.</p>
<p>The quality of your life is a reflection  of your mind. Your mind creates a behavioural pattern. It is usually defined as  the faculty of an entity's thought and consciousness. It holds the power of  imagination, recognition and appreciation and it is responsible for processing  feelings and emotions resulting in attitudes and action.<br />
  THE SPIRIT, SOUL AND BODY<br />
  Man is a tripartite being made up  of the spirit, soul and body. These three parts have different functions but  they all work together.<br />
  THE BODY: This is the physical  structure of man i.e. the physical part of a person that can be seen and  touched. The body is mortal and it will decay when a man dies. The body is that  part of a man that is selfish and desires satisfaction. It is the fleshy part  the bible says we should not gratify. The body of a man responds to his soul  and spirit. It sometimes contradicts the spirit because of its lustful desires.  It is the part of man that will return to the soil and decay. Hmm, vanity upon  vanity. Why then do we gratify our fleshly desires when it profits nothing and  will decay?<br />
  THE SOUL: It is the immortal part  of man. It is not physical. It is the faculty of reasoning, will and emotion.  The soul of a man is responsible for his thoughts, imaginations, visualization,  his feelings and where he creates his fantasies. The soul responds to the  spirit of man. A natural man thinks of evil because of his nature and spirit.  Oh! You may say that there are natural men that do no evil, but the truth is  that there is none. Any natural man who does or acts well has only brought in  moral standards into his life by religion, culture and societal standards as  discussed in earlier factors. It will be good to note that these standards are  just temporary actions. They act well outside but their thoughts are evil. A  man's soul is affected by his spirit, which he possesses. Feed your soul with  the word of God.<br />
  THE SPIRIT: This is the eternal  part of man. This is the real man that will be judged after death. Man is a  spirit being. God created us in His own image and likeness (Genesis 1:26). God  is a Spirit (John 4:245a). <br />
  <br />
  But as a result of the fall of  man, the evil spirit entered into him. Now, Jesus Christ has reconciled us back  to the father. So when we got saved in Christ, we became possessed by the  Spirit of God. A man can either be possessed by the Holy Spirit or an evil  spirit. You cannot be possessed by both spirits at a time. The spirit of man is  the candle of the Lord, searching the inward parts of the belly (Proverbs  20:27). Man communicates with God via his spirit and as a believer, our spirit  searches for the deep things of God. God communicates primarily with the spirit  of man and the evil one does the same through their own means.</p>
<p>We the children of God speak in  tongue and mysteries are unfolded to us as we tarry more in His presence.  Building up your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Ghost. Our faith is built  up when we pray in the Holy Ghost.<br />
  At salvation, our body did not  change. If you were a woman before you accepted Christ, you are still a woman  afterwards. If you are tall before salvation, you are still tall afterwards.  Our spirit changes automatically when we confess Christ as our Lord. The spirit  of God comes to us and our old nature leaves. Now, at salvation, our soul  doesn't change automatically. This is where a lot of believers miss it. But  it's subject to change by renewing our mind daily with the word of God. Though  the spirit has influence over us, our mind is a programmed device, it has been  programmed with the old nature so it takes the word of God to reprogramme it.  Also, the word of God makes us aware of who we are in Christ.<br />
  One of the biggest mistakes  people make when trying to understand others is looking at their behaviour out  of context or their psychological make-up.<br />
  The problem with that approach is  that it results in a superficial judgement of others based on one situation.  The other approach is that it doesn't take into consideration that two people  could be doing the same thing for different reasons. We behave and do many of  the things we do as a result of experience.<br />
  The subconscious mind directs  people's actions and if you want to understand why people behave the way they  do, then you must clearly understand their past for it holds the clue to that  which you seek.</p>
<p> <br />
  Temperament is the combination of  inborn traits that subconsciously affect all our behaviour. These traits which  are passed on by our genes are based on hereditary factors and arranged at  conception. Our individual temperament influences what we focus on. Our  individual temperament affects our daily habit – the way we interact with  people, clean our house, drive, do our daily chores, etc.  A person's gender will also affect his or her  temperament, especially when it comes to emotions. For example, women are  emotionally expressive than men. Even the strongest woman tends to cry while  men may weep once in a while or secretly. A man and a woman may have the same  temperament but they largely express emotions differently. It is a person's  temperament that makes one introvert or extrovert.<br />
  At our moment of conception, we  all inherited a basic genetic temperament that contains both our strengths and  weaknesses. This temperament is called so many things in the bible -- the  flesh, natural man, the old man, etc.<br />
  If you think deeply, you will see  that you possess one or two of your parents' or grandparents' temperament. I  remember when my baby started crawling. I will always shout at her unknowingly  to leave one place or the other. Aside from that, she does some things that  should require just a talk from me but I will shout at her. It then occurred to  me that I was beginning to exhibit my mum's temperament which is a weakness on  her side. I had to pray to God and allow the Holy Spirit to help my weakness.  Yours could be a different story, but mind you, one's temperament could either  be a weakness or strength. For example, a man can be quiet while another is  troublesome, etc. Temperament has more influence on our behaviours. It is the  number one influence on us. For us to properly understand our temperament, our  actions and reactions, then we need to understand some terms properly:  personality, character, attitude and behaviour. </p>
<p>CHARACTER<br />
  The character is the real you. It  is what you do in the secret. It is what you do when you are given freedom to  do anything that suits you. It is the mental and moral quality that  distinguishes you from others. It is a product of your temperament modified by  childhood training, environment, education, beliefs, attitudes, principles,  motivations, habits, etc. It is the net result of all the influences of people  around you from your childhood till now through education, culture, religious  beliefs, societal traits or influence, etc. The character is simply an  expression of who you are.<br />
  <br />
  ATTITUDE<br />
  Attitude is your response or  reaction with respect to your character and personality. It is your mannerism  or feeling about something as a result of your ideology resulting from your  character.<br />
  <br />
  BEHAVIOUR<br />
  Behaviour is the way you act or  conduct yourself, especially to others. Behaviour is your response to  situations.<br />
  <br />
  PERSONALITY<br />
  Personality is defined as the  habitual behaviour, discernment and emotional patterns that evolve from our  temperament. It is the outward expression of one's self which may or may not be  the same as one's character, depending on how truthful or sincere the person is  to himself or herself. You can deceive others but you cannot deceive God and  yourself. Some people tend to portray what they are not inwardly just for the  acceptance and praise of men but it doesn't last for a long time. Like an adage  says, &quot;Your character is like a flame it cannot be hidden for long&quot;.  Your personality is your modified character. Many are acting on the basis of  what they think they should be as a person, rather than who they really are.  Whatsoever you do inside and you cannot portray outside is not your real  personality.</p>
<p>Your character can be modified  when you discover it's bringing havoc to you. It starts with your heart and the  willingness to make a change. Concerning your habit, you must be conscious of  what you do daily, your environment, the people you interact with, what you  listen to, what you watch and read religious beliefs, educational and moral  training. All of these influence your character and it can be modified if you  properly train yourself.</p>
<p>After merely meeting someone for  the first time and if the person talks with me for some few minutes, I can  actually say a little of what he/she is made up of from our conversation. What  you say tells a lot about your mind, heart, knowledge, wisdom, understanding  and your reasoning. You cannot give what you don't have. You only talk to the  extent of your knowledge and exposure. I can tell if you are a natural man,  spiritual or carnal. Our conversation is an end result (product) of our  thoughts.</p>
