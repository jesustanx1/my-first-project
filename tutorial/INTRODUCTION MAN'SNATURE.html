<p><br />
There is no love compared to the  love of our heavenly Father, the Maker of heaven, earth and everything  underneath the earth. The scripture confirms His immeasurable love towards us  by saying: while we were yet sinners His only begotten Son died for our sins.  He does not condemn us in our sinful state. He has a way of bringing us closer  to Him. His arms are always open. If God was a man, what would have been the  outcome of man's existence?<br />
Despite all the pains and  rejection that you might feel when you sit back to think inwardly, you will  find out that God has always been there to see you through them all. God's gift  of life, hope and joy sees you through them all. He is always there to comfort  us in the midst of our pains, struggles and He answers all our prayers. God is  forever faithful. The only One that binds the brokenhearted and answers all  their questions.<br />
This book is a product of several  emotional breakdowns I experienced with different individuals. In December  2017, my maid left suddenly without a proper goodbye despite having planned our  travelling together. It was really shocking because there was no  misunderstanding or any signal that she was going to leave.<br />
This incident made me realize how  unpredictable and unreliable man can be. Sometimes, I ask myself questions like  why do I experience surprises, disappointment and heartbreaks from people. I  once had this belief that once one is saved, one is forever guided from  unpleasant happenings. The Holy Spirit answered me through following that:</p>
<p>1)  I expect too much from people.<br />
  2)  My service is not completely to God but also  to man.<br />
  3)  My vulnerability makes people have full  access to me. <br />
  4)  I sometimes put my trust in man<br />
