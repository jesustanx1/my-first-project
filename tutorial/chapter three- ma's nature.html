<h1 align="center"> CHAPTER THREE</h1>
<p align="center"><br />
Proverbs 27:17, 17:7<br />
It is important you understand  people if you want to succeed in life. If you don't understand people and their  stand in your life, you may miss out God's blessing for your life. You need to  understand people and accept them for who they are. Understand the fact that  you can't change a man. Only God can change a man. When you meet people, try to  understand their composition and temperament. When you understand their  temperament, it means you are ready to respect their strengths and weaknesses.  With this, you will not expect too much from their nature and you will help  manage their weaknesses. I must confess to you, no man is perfect; we all have  our strengths and weaknesses. It's the Holy Spirit that helps our weaknesses.  He has made our weakness perfect in His strength.<br />
 <br />
Our temperaments affect the way  we live, the way we react to things and our daily activities. For example, a  choleric is a rough driver, very aggressive and never gives you a chance to for  other drivers to overtake him. A sanguine is always talking while driving and  sometimes loses focus. People can be your greatest asset and greatest problem.  Through our friendship with different people, we must be able to sharpen our  behaviour. One should not just try to force himself on people. Instead, try to  understand people and their ideologies. It is not everybody that one must refer  to as a friend. This does not mean one should be hostile but one needs to be  careful of the kind of people one allows into one's life. Also, the people you  want is different from the people you need. Remember your want can be selfish  and deadly sometimes. Make a deliberate effort to attract certain people  (Positive-minded people) and reject people who do not make a positive impact in  your life. If that person you call your friend is not adding or impacting to  you, then you should not allow them into your life. Learn to relate to people  based on who they are. Give yourself standards, be purpose-driven. When you are  purpose-driven, not just anybody will fit into your life. <br />
Your friends will either add to  you, subtract, divide or multiply you. Also, you need to know that you need  people but the right people. Nobody can be an island. I remember sometimes in  the past when I told my hubby that I didn't need people and that I can live my  life alone and be fine. As I grew older and had more responsibilities, I  realized that I need people and when I started moving with the right people,  things began to change for me. Without people, the vision will not be  accomplished because it is people that need the vision. Proverbs 29:18a says,  &quot;where there is no vision, the people perish.&quot;  Therefore, where there are no people, visions  perish. Be the kind of person you want people to be to you.  The true nature of people is revealed when they  relate to someone that they are not benefitting from or when they are in their  secret place. As I discussed personality in chapter 2, people can modify their  personality by pretending to be who they feel they should be, not who they  truly are.</p>
<p>HEARTBREAK<br />
  It so disheartening and traumatic  when people go through heartbreaks, especially when they come from people we  deeply love. A broken heart comes with great emotional pain that might make  someone lose his/her senses. A heartbreak is a term used to describe a soothing  grief, anguish or distress often due to the pain of love or too much  expectation from people.  It is state of  brokenness in the heart. In other words, the heart ceases to function in  wholeness. According to science, heartbreak causes an increase in blood  pressure and heart rate which can raise cardiovascular risk. This situation  really puts the human heart at a great risk. Funny enough, we all go through  heartbreaks in one way or the other. Most people believe heartbreak is  associated with the female because of their fragile nature but it's not true.  Men feel this pain too. <br />
  Heartbreak is a mirage when we  totally depend on God. As stated by a friend, Joan Vitaligis. &quot;the summary  of heartbreak in life is simply Ignorance&quot;. Lack of knowledge is  destructive (Hosea 4:6). Ignorance will make a person trust in a man that will  fail. Ignorance makes a person heartbroken when he/she faces trials. When God  is with us, we will overcome (Isaiah 43:2, Psalms 30:5).<br />
  Everything we go through on earth  is not new nor strange (1 Peter 4:12-13) Joan Vitaligis went further with a  testimony of how God healed her of an unexpected heartbreak&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;In July 2017, I lost my  unborn daughter. I was eight months pregnant, almost due for delivery. I was  angry, confused, disappointed and sad. Even though God saved my life in the  process I was heartbroken. I cried out to God and held on to the word of God.  It wasn't easy but in no time, I was up on my feet healed and restored. I  believe in the healing power of Jesus Christ and He healed me both physically  and emotionally. Praise God!!!&quot;<br />
  <br />
  We relate to people the way we  see life. The way we see life shapes us consciously or unconsciously. This is  something that shapes the way we think, act, behave, relate to people, manage  money, react to things, and manage our relationship with God and man. For  example, you can say you don't like visiting people. This ideology could arise  from how badly you were once treated or probably somebody who had that  experience had told you or you watched it in a movie and just concluded in your  heart consciously or unconsciously that you won't visit people. The human mind  is subconsciously influenced by what we see, hear and experience over a period  of time. The thing here is the consistency with which we experience these  things.</p>
<p>Ultimately, our outward behaviour  takes its root from our thoughts, ideas or images that arise in our heart. We  can't change our character if we don't change our thoughts or mind. The way we  see life influences our perception and our relationship amongst other things.  It is important to see life from God's perspective. Let your heart and mind be  renewed through the word of God. Do you know what the word of God says about  your life? You need to find out.</p>
