<h2 align="center"> GOD'S BIG PICTURE</h2>
<p>The  most important thing about living on earth is knowing why you are here and God  is the only one who can tell you why you are here because he made you. Let us  look at it critically from the beginning.   First of all, it will interest you to know that what you call your  future is an agenda designed by God to bring glory to his name. However, this  agenda is also designed to honor you in the process but it is up to you to  decide to accept God’s agenda or not. I think it will be a smart move to decide  to follow his agenda because God created the agenda. God created the agenda  before he created you. Before God created you in the womb he knew you and  created an assignment for you to do. In fact it was because of the assignment  he created you custom built to fit that assignment and then God wired you with  gifts and talents and the passion that will help you accomplish that  assignment. So, everything you need has always been inside you from the  beginning. When you know this it becomes easier to trust  God with your Future. </p>
<ul>
  <li>Firstly, you have to acknowledge that God is the source  of your life and owner of the future you desire. God created you for a purpose  and there is something God will like you to specifically do on His behalf while  you are on earth.</li>
  <li>Secondly, you need to know that your assignment is God’s  idea and not yours. It is very important to Him that you recognize that you are  His representative or ambassador standing in for Him to carry out His plan. In  other words, you don’t choose your assignment you discover it.</li>
  <li>Thirdly, everything you need to know about this awesome  plan that will make your life colorful is tied to a functional relationship  with God.</li>
</ul>

<p align="center">Jer 1:4-7 4 <br />
  <em>Then the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 5  Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee; and before thou camest forth out  of the womb I sanctified thee, and I ordained thee a prophet unto the  nations.   6 Then said I, Ah, Lord  GOD!   Behold, I cannot speak:  for I am a child.   7 But the LORD said unto me, Say not, I am a  child:  for thou shalt go to all that I  shall send thee, and whatsoever I command thee thou shalt speak.</em></p>

<p>We will discuss  three important things that can suggest to you or help you discover God’s plan  for your life. This is important because everything you need to make your life  colourful is embedded in your assignment. These three variables hold clues and  sometimes serve as indicators or pointers to who God made you to be or what he  wants you to do. Other times, these clues only serve as avenues or channels  that point you to the problem you are designed to solve.</p>
